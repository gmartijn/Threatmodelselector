# Threat Model Selector 3000™ 🛡️✨

> *"Because choosing the wrong threat model is only slightly less
> embarrassing than turning up to a black-tie dinner in your pajamas."*
> 🕴️😴

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What is this? 🤔

This is a Python script that asks you six deeply probing, soul-searching
questions like:\
- "Are you focusing mainly on system design & technical threats?" 🖥️🔧\
- "Is privacy and personal data compliance a main concern?" 🔒🧑‍⚖️\
- "Do you ever wake up at 3 a.m. screaming 'PASTA!' and then realize you
were just hungry?" 🍝😱

Based on your answers (which are mysteriously restricted to **yes** or
**no** because nuance is for philosophers 🧘‍♂️), the script then
recommends a threat modeling methodology.\
It's like speed-dating 💘, but for frameworks 📊.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## How it works ⚙️

1.  You run the script. ▶️\
2.  It interrogates you like a mildly sarcastic customs officer. 🛂😏\
3.  You reply with `yes` or `no` (or their cousins `y/n/true/false` if
    you're feeling rebellious 😎).\
4.  Out pops your destiny in the form of a threat model:
    -   **STRIDE** if you like tidy diagrams and lists. 📝\
    -   **LINDDUN** if GDPR haunts your dreams. 👻📜\
    -   **PASTA** if you think in seven stages and secretly wish you
        worked in a kitchen. 🍝👨‍🍳\
    -   **OCTAVE/FAIR** if you prefer thinking in balance sheets. 📈💰\
    -   **Attack Trees** if you doodle elaborate plots on napkins. 🌳🖊️\
    -   **VAST** if you believe Agile can, in fact, be made more
        complex. 🌀🐇\
    -   Or, failing all else, the script shrugs and says *"combine stuff
        and hope for the best."* 🤷‍♂️✨

## Installation 📥

``` bash
git clone you-must-be-joking
cd threat_model_selector
pip install absolutely-nothing
```

You already have Python. 🐍\
If not, what are you even doing here? 🤨

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Usage 🖱️

**Interactive:**

``` bash
python threat_model_selector.py
```

**Non-interactive** (for robots 🤖, introverts 🙈, and continuous
integration pipelines 🛠️):

``` bash
python threat_model_selector.py --q1 yes --q2 no --q3 yes --q4 no --q5 no --q6 yes
```

**JSON output** (for people who prefer their destiny machine-parsable
📦):

``` bash
python threat_model_selector.py --json
```

## Frequently Asked Questions ❓💡

**Q: What if I answer all questions with "no"?**\
A: Congratulations 🎉. You've just invented your own new methodology
called *Procrastinate-Driven Development™*. 🛋️⏳

**Q: Can I extend the script to include my own exotic frameworks?**\
A: Yes 🙌. Please do. Especially if it has a ridiculous acronym 🤪.

**Q: Why does this README sound slightly unhinged?**\
A: Because security is serious 🔐, but explanations don't have to be 😂.
