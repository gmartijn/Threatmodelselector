# Threat Model Selector 3000™  

> *"Because choosing the wrong threat model is only slightly less embarrassing than turning up to a black-tie dinner in your pajamas."*

## What is this?  

This is a Python script that asks you six deeply probing, soul-searching questions like:  
- “Are you focusing mainly on system design & technical threats?”  
- “Is privacy and personal data compliance a main concern?”  
- “Do you ever wake up at 3 a.m. screaming ‘PASTA!’ and then realize you were just hungry?”  

Based on your answers (which are mysteriously restricted to **yes** or **no** because nuance is for philosophers), the script then recommends a threat modeling methodology.  
It’s like speed-dating, but for frameworks.

## How it works  

1. You run the script.  
2. It interrogates you like a mildly sarcastic customs officer.  
3. You reply with `yes` or `no` (or their cousins `y/n/true/false` if you’re feeling rebellious).  
4. Out pops your destiny in the form of a threat model:  
   - **STRIDE** if you like tidy diagrams and lists.  
   - **LINDDUN** if GDPR haunts your dreams.  
   - **PASTA** if you think in seven stages and secretly wish you worked in a kitchen.  
   - **OCTAVE/FAIR** if you prefer thinking in balance sheets.  
   - **Attack Trees** if you doodle elaborate plots on napkins.  
   - **VAST** if you believe Agile can, in fact, be made more complex.  
   - Or, failing all else, the script shrugs and says *“combine stuff and hope for the best.”*

## Installation  

```bash
git clone you-must-be-joking
cd threat_model_selector
pip install absolutely-nothing
```

You already have Python. If not, what are you even doing here?

## Usage  

Interactive:  
```bash
python threat_model_selector.py
```

Non-interactive (for robots, introverts, and continuous integration pipelines):  
```bash
python threat_model_selector.py --q1 yes --q2 no --q3 yes --q4 no --q5 no --q6 yes
```

JSON output (for people who prefer their destiny machine-parsable):  
```bash
python threat_model_selector.py --json
```

## Frequently Asked Questions  

**Q: What if I answer all questions with "no"?**  
A: Congratulations. You’ve just invented your own new methodology called *Procrastinate-Driven Development™*.  

**Q: Can I extend the script to include my own exotic frameworks?**  
A: Yes. Please do. Especially if it has a ridiculous acronym.  

**Q: Why does this README sound slightly unhinged?**  
A: Because security is serious, but explanations don’t have to be.
