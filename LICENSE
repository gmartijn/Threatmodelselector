Infinite Improbability License (IIL), Version 1.0

Copyright (c) [YEAR] [YOUR NAME OR ORG]

Preamble
---------
This license is powered by an Infinite Improbability Drive, which means 
it is simultaneously very strict, very permissive, and mildly confusing, 
all at the same time. Use at your own risk, or at someone else’s if you 
can convincingly blame them.

Terms and Conditions
--------------------

1. Permission
   You are free to use, copy, modify, fork, fold, spindle, or mutilate 
   this software in any dimension of space-time you choose.

2. Distribution
   Redistribution is permitted, encouraged, and may occasionally be 
   rewarded with tea. However, recipients must be warned that they 
   might suddenly turn into a bowl of petunias without notice.

3. Warranty
   This software comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY. In fact, it may 
   actively conspire against you. The authors disclaim responsibility 
   for:
     - Any spontaneous generation of black holes,
     - Sudden existential dread,
     - Unscheduled poetry readings,
     - Loss of time, space, or towels.

4. Liability
   In the event that something goes wrong, please consult the nearest 
   improbability field generator, then blame the Vogons.

5. Compliance
   By using this software, you agree that:
     - A towel is still the most massively useful thing an interstellar 
       threat modeler can carry.
     - "Yes" and "No" are sufficient answers to any question posed by 
       this software, regardless of nuance.

6. Termination
   This license terminates automatically if:
     - You take it too seriously,
     - Or, paradoxically, if you don’t take it seriously enough.

Closing Remark
--------------
If you have read this far, congratulations: you are now the proud owner 
of one (1) Infinite Improbability License. May it serve you both well, 
and improbably.
