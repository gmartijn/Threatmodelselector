# Security Vulnerability Reporting Policy  

First of all: **thank you** for even suspecting that our code might contain a security vulnerability.  
Frankly, you’re probably right. We wrote it while over-caffeinated and slightly distracted by the neighbour’s cat.

## How to Report a Vulnerability  

1. **Remain Calm.**  
   Panic helps nobody, least of all the poor developers.  

2. **Open a GitHub Issue.**  
   - Go to the "Issues" tab.  
   - Click "New Issue".  
   - Give it a suitably dramatic title, such as:  
     - *“The End of Days is Nigh (SQL Injection Edition)”*  
     - *“I Have Found a Hole and Crawled Through It”*  
     - *“Security? More Like Insecurity, Amirite?”*  

3. **Describe the Vulnerability.**  
   Please include:  
   - What you did.  
   - What happened.  
   - What you expected to happen instead (e.g., “not a dumpster fire”).  

4. **Optional Flourishes.**  
   - ASCII art illustrating the bug.  
   - Haikus.  
   - Interpretive dance (though GitHub’s markdown support is limited).

## What Not to Do  

- Don’t sell the vulnerability to aliens. They already know.  
- Don’t tweet it in ALL CAPS before we’ve had a chance to fix it.  
- Don’t attach a ransom note made of magazine clippings. It’s tacky.

## What We’ll Do  

- We’ll acknowledge your issue faster than you can say *“infinite improbability drive.”*  
- We may reward you with:  
  - A virtual high five,  
  - A thank-you in a commit message,  
  - Or, if you’re lucky, an animated GIF reaction.

## Closing Note  

By reporting vulnerabilities via GitHub Issues, you agree that:  
- We’re fallible humans, not omniscient beings of pure logic.  
- The odds of us fixing the bug before it mutates into something worse are… well… improbable, but not impossible.  

So please, file your issue.  
We promise not to assign it the label `wontfix` (probably).
