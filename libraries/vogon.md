# Congratulations 🎉

You have unlocked the **VOGON Threat Model™** 👽📚\
Because sometimes the greatest threat isn't hackers... it's *compliance
poetry*.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# VOGON Threat Model™ 🛡️✨

> *"Resistance is useless. And so is security documentation written in
> Vogon poetry."*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What does VOGON stand for?

**V** -- *Very*\
**O** -- *Overengineered*\
**G** -- *Governance*\
**O** -- *Obfuscation*\
**N** -- *Narrative*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Methodology 📖

1.  **Very Overengineered** -- Start by introducing as much complexity
    as possible. If it's simple, it can't be secure, right?\
2.  **Governance** -- Apply at least six overlapping frameworks (ISO,
    NIST, COBIT, GDPR, SOX, HIPAA), regardless of relevance.\
3.  **Obfuscation** -- Document all findings in obscure legalese or
    auto-generated XML that nobody can parse.\
4.  **Narrative** -- Present results as a 3-hour Vogon poetry recital to
    the board. Bonus points if executives cry.

Don't forget your **towel** 🧣---the most massively useful thing an
interstellar threat modeler can carry.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Strengths 💪

-   Nobody will *ever* understand your system, including attackers.\
-   Compliance officers will be too busy decoding your 900-page report
    to ask hard questions.\
-   Provides exactly **42** controls, none of which map to reality.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Weaknesses 😬

-   Usability: *negative infinity*.\
-   May cause existential dread, migraines, and/or spontaneous despair
    in stakeholders.\
-   False sense of security ("If it's incomprehensible, it must be
    secure!").

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Example Use Case 🚀

-   Multinational bureaucracy with infinite budget and zero delivery
    deadlines.\
-   Organizations where the **BSO** secretly enjoys watching auditors
    suffer.\
-   Any project where the **primary attack vector is boredom**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Remember: When all else fails... read the poetry until the attacker
surrenders.* 🎤😵
